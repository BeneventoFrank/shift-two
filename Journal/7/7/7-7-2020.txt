

so i guess this is my first entry. i just got your email.  it took me almost two hours to type that response. lol. 
the truth is there were so many things i wanted to say, but i didn't want to throw to much shock at you.. I have been
meaning to write these and now i have a reason.  

so lets start with the first thing... what is shift two?  

Shift two is meant to be the best of myself, given to you. i am planning on creating widgets and packaging them up as npm packages. 
the first widget i am building for you is the Editable Data Grid.  this has been a painful development experience so far. i'll add tons more 
details later. I have to work for a while, deadline in the morning. i'll be up all night tonight so i will write more.
