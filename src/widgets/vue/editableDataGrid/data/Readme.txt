
The editable data grid is a cool project that i worked on for Vc. you probably don't know what that is.. lol not important.  that was version 1, this is 2.0.


Goals:
    Provide easy to configure grid to present data.
        - this will be done with data.json
    Provide a decent feature set. paging, sorting, filtering, edit, add, delete
    Do it without any dependencies
